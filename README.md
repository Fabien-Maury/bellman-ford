# Bellman-Ford algorithm
Python3 implementation of Bellman-Ford algorithm for shortest path in negative-weighted graphs

# Input : 
  * a tuple containing : 
    - a list of vertices
    - a list of edges written as : (vertex1, vertex2, weight)
  
  * source : the vertex used as source for the pathes
  
# Output : 
  * a tuple containing : 
    - a dictionnary of the shortest distance to each vertex
    - a dictionnary of the previous vertex used in the path to each vertex shortest distance
